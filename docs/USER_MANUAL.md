## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Asset index not found" Error
**Solution**: Run the asset scanner
```bash
./scripts/scan_assets.sh
```

#### Dashboard Won't Load
**Possible Causes**:
1. **Port already in use**: Try stopping other servers
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop_server.sh
   ```
2. **Permission issues**: Ensure scripts are executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

#### No Products Showing
**Check**:
1. OneDrive path is correct in `.env` file
2. OneDrive is synced and accessible
3. Product folders follow naming convention (5-digit codes)

#### Search Not Working
1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Try restarting the dashboard

#### Files Won't Open
**macOS Security**:
- Some files may require security approval
- Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
- Allow the blocked application

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading
- **Large Asset Libraries**: Normal for 7,000+ assets
- **Network Issues**: Ensure OneDrive is fully synced
- **Memory**: Close other applications if needed

#### Scan Taking Too Long
- **Normal Duration**: 3-10 minutes for full scan
- **Optimization**: Close other OneDrive applications
- **Interruption**: Use Ctrl+C to cancel if needed

### Getting Help

Check these locations for detailed error information:
- `logs/vital_planet_asset_hub.log`
